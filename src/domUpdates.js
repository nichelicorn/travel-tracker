// Anticipated UI

// - on page load, the dollar counter will diplay the total amount spent on trips this year
// - on page load, a welcome message appears that displays the user's first name
// - on page load, a card display appears showing information about a user's travels
  // - these will be listed by date in descending order

// - when the `book the Tardis` button is clicked,
  // the home page will be hidden
  // the booking page will be unhidden
// a form for booking appears on the page
  // the user will select a destination from a dropdown menu
  // the user will select a start date from a calendar
  // the user will input the desired trip duration
  // the user will input the number of travelers
    // use the HTML `require` attribute for form elements
  //the estimated cost of the trip will appear once all fields are complete

// when the user clicks the `submit request` button
  // a request for a new trip will be sent to the agent
  // the booking page will be hidden
  // the home page will be unhidden
  // a new card with the pending trip will appear at the top of the card stack
    // will display a pending tag
